MASM - Low Level input-output and macros

Implements ReadVal and WriteVal procedures for signed integers
Implements macros getString and displayString

Description: 
This program gets 10 valid integers from the user, and stores the numeric values in an array, and displays the integers, their sum, and their average. This program uses readVal procedure which invokes the getString macro to get the user's string of digits.  It then converts the digit string to numeric and validates user input.  Using writeVal procedure, it converts the numeric values to a string of digits, invoking the displayString macro to produce the output.
